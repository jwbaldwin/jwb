### Tech Stack

**API**: Elixir and Phoenix

I can't say enough about this language and framework. It truly "10x'd" my development speed. I'm an avid Elixir and Phoenix fan.

For learning Elixir/Phoenix my recomendations are:

* [Elixir in Action by Sasa Juric](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action)
* [Programming Phoenix by Chris McCord, Bruce Tate and Jose Valim](https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4/)

**Frontend**: Vue + Tailwindcss

Vue gives me a simpler development experience than React, taking more of a "batteries included/blessed" approach. I previously wrote the frontend in React/Redux but migrated to Vue/Vuex later. All styling is done with Tailwindcss.

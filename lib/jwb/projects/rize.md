This was an iOS app built alongside two friends that sought to combine viral "trends" with supporting small businesses.

We launched it after two rounds of user testing. Received over one hundred downloads on the app store and onboarded multiple businesses to partake in the two-sided marketplace.

I still think this could have been big ;)

I don't think this is still on the app store, but it was for a while.

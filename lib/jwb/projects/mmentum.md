### What is it?
> “All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger.”\
> ― James Clear, Atomic Habits

</br>

In this same vein of thinking, Mmentum is an application that helps me track and build my habits.

It is dead-simple, clean, and only focused on helping people take small steps toward who they want to be. It helps you build up that incremental momentum towards the person you want to be

### Tech Stack

I'm using the PETAL stack for this. Working with this stack (Elixir/Phoenix specifically) has had the largest impact on my developer happiness.

If you haven't given this stack (Or just Elixir) a try, do it! And tell me when you do! 

P - Phoenix

E - Elixir

T - TailwindCSS

L - LiveView
